### Installation
There are four ways to use ZLPhotoBrowser in your project:

  - using CocoaPods
  - using Carthage
  - using Swift Package Manager
  - manual install (build frameworks or embed Xcode Project)

#### CocoaPods
To integrate ZLPhotoBrowser into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it to a target in your Podfile:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  # your other pod
  # ...
  pod 'ZLPhotoBrowser'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```
$ pod install
```

> If you cannot find the latest version, you can execute `pod repo update` first

#### Carthage
To integrate ZLPhotoBrowser into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```
github "longitachi/ZLPhotoBrowser"
```

Then, run the following command to build the ZLPhotoBrowser framework:

```shell
$ carthage update
```

If you get an error like `Building universal frameworks with common architectures is not possible. The device and simulator slices for "ZLPhotoBrowser" both build for: arm64
Rebuild with --use-xcframeworks to create an xcframework bundle instead.` [Click this link](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Xcode12Workaround.md).

#### Swift Package Manager
1. Select File > Add Packages. Enter https://github.com/longitachi/ZLPhotoBrowser.git in the "Choose Package Repository" dialog.
2. In the next page, specify the version resolving rule as "Up to Next Major" with "4.5.6" as its earliest version.
3. After Xcode checking out the source and resolving the version, you can choose the "ZLPhotoBrowser" library and add it to your app target.
